### **Scenario**

As the world grapples with an escalating climate crisis, a covert race unfolds among nations, each vying to attain carbon neutrality. This clandestine competition extends beyond environmental aspirations, weaving a narrative of potential superpowers emerging in technology, defense, economy, and the pivotal realm of renewable energy. In this high-stakes thriller, my data analysis skills become the lens through which I navigate the shadowy landscape, peeling back layers of complexity to unravel the present condition. With suspense hanging in the air, I embark on a quest to predict the elusive winner in this global, high-octane pursuit of renewable energy dominance. The stage is set, and the future hangs in the balance as nations navigate the twists and turns of this consequential race.
